# Tutorials

This folder provides tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks for various functionality supported by the software.

- init_configs: Detailed instructions for generating, relaxing, and selecting initial configurations for MD simulations.

- HFF_100KB: Instructions for setting up and performing MD simulations of a human nucleus using optimized parameters. Two integrators, Langevin dynamics or Brownian dynamics, can be used to simulations. The model also supports deforming the nucleus from a perfect spherical geometry.

- compute_contact_prob: Instructions for computing contact probablities between chromosomes to compare with Hi-C data, and for computing chromosome-nuclear landmarks contact probabilities to compared with Lamin B DamID and SON TSA-Seq.

- optimization: Instructions for optimizing model parameters.

- new_feature: Tutorial for expanding the software to introduce new features and components to the nucleus model.
