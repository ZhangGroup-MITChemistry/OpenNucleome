## Generate configurations from scratch

Here, as an example, we only generate 10 initial configurations used for following simulations

- ConfigsGeneration.ipynb: Output the indexes of 10 initial configurations into './init_config_pool', and users can change the number of initial configs in this file

- init_config_pool: Save all the initial generated configurations

- averaged_damid.txt: averaged DamID signals of homologous chromosomes and every bead.

- bead_info.txt: Contains the information of each chromatin bead. 1st column: the index of each bead; 2nd column: the index of belonging chromosome; 3rd column: the type of each chromatin bead.
