## chromosome-chromosome optimization code

- chr_chr_optimization.ipynb: call and optimizes the chromosome-chromosome interactions (ideal, compt-compt, interchr)

- adam_chr_chr_param: save all the parameters used in the adam optimization for the chromosome-chromosome interactions

- potential: save all the potentials used in chr-chr interactions

- frame_10.dcd: trajectory file example which contains 10 frames

- contact_prob: store all the chromosome-chromosome contact probabilities, the number of contacts, and the number of analyzed frames

- expt_constraints_HFF_100KB.txt: experimental chromosome-chromosome contact probabilities, the first 2489 values are ideal contacts, the next 6 are compt-compt contacts, and the remaining 231 are interchromosomal contacts
