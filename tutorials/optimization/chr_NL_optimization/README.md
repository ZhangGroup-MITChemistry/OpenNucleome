## chromosome-nuclear landmarks optimization code

ChrNLOptimization.ipynb logs the process of optimizing interaction parameters between chromosome and nuclear landmarks. 

The pipline is the same as that in the folder "../chr_chr_optimization"

- DamID-OE.txt: experimental DamID sequencing data

- TSA-Seq-OE.txt: experimental TSASeq sequencing data

- mol_info: save all the molecular information files necessary for computing contact probabilities

- adam_chr_NL_param: save all the parameters used in the adam optimization for the chromosome-nuclear landmarks interactions

- potential: save all the potentials used in the chr-NL interactions

- reduced_traj.dcd: trajectory file example which contains 50 frames
