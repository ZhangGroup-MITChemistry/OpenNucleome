## HFF model with nuclear landmarks at 100KB resolution

This folder provides tutorials for setting up and performing simulations of the HFF nucleusi at the 100KB resolution with the presence of various nuclear landmarks, including nuclear lamina, speckles, and nucleoli.

- SphericalNucleus
    1. This tutorial explains how to setup simulations of a spherical nucleus.

- NuclearDeformation
    1. This tutorial explains how to setup simulations to introduce external forces that deform the nucleus.
