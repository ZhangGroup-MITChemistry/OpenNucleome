## Spherical Nucleus with Langevin Dynamics

This folder provides tutorials for setting up and performing Langevin Dynamics simulations of the HFF nucleus at the 100KB resolution with the presence of various nuclear landmarks, including nuclear lamina, speckles, and nucleoli.

- initial_configs: This folder contains 50 initial configurations, which were chosen according to the "Section: Initial configurations for simulations"

- LangevinSimulation.ipynb: The jupyter notebook showing how to create a system and run a simulation. 

- results: This folder contains the trajectory and new configuration files after running the notebook "LangevinSimulation.ipynb".

- final_configs: This folder contains the corresponding 50 final configurations after running 10,000,000 steps for each initial configuration.
