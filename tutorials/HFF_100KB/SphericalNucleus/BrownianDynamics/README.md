## Spherical Nucleus with Brownian Dynamics

This folder provides tutorials for setting up and performing Brownian Dynamics simulations of the HFF nucleus at the 100KB resolution with the presence of various nuclear landmarks, including nuclear lamina, speckles, and nucleoli.

- initial_configs: This folder contains 8 initial configurations

- BrownianSimulation.ipynb: The jupyter notebook showing how to create a system and run a simulation.

- results: This folder contains the trajectory and new configuration files after running the notebook "BrownianSimulation.ipynb".

- final_configs: This folder contains the corresponding 8 final configurations after running 30,000,000 steps for each initial configuration.
