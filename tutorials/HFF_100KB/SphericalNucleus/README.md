## HFF model with nuclear landmarks at 100KB resolution

This folder provides tutorials for setting up and performing simulations of the HFF nucleus at the 100KB resolution with the presence of various nuclear landmarks, including nuclear lamina, speckles, and nucleoli.

- Brownian Dynamics
    1. These simulations provide better approximations of the overdamped dynamics of chromatin for direct comparison with live cell imaging studies

- Langevin Dynamics
    1. Langevin dynamics simulations allow faster chromosome movements, compared to Brownian dynamics simulations, facilitating the conformational sampling
