# Tutorials

This folder provides tutorials for generating, relaxing, and selecting initial configurations.

- configs_generation: Generate unrelaxed configurations randomly. Specifically, the users will generate many possible configurations, such as 1000.

- configs_relaxation: Relax all the configurations generated above.

- configs_selection: Select part of configurations to make the normalized radial position and interchromosomal contacts more consistent with experiments.
