# openNucleome

openNucleome supports OpenMM GPU-accelerated simulations of the three-dimensional architecture of genomes. It is flexible and allows adding the potential for chromosomes-chromosomes and chromosomes-nuclear bodies with custom values. The package dramatically simplifies the simulation setup: users only need a few lines of python code to carry out the genome simulations starting from initial configurations of 46 chromosomes, nucleoli, speckles, and lamina, which form a cell nucleus. The package is integrated with OpenMM, a GPU-accelerated MD simulation engine enabling efficient simulations. We provide tutorials to demonstrate the various capabilities. We anticipate openNucleome to significantly facilitate for simulating the three-dimensinoal architecture of genomes.
